        <P>Description: Pavlova is an iconic cake with an unmistakable appearance: an elegant meringue 
            filled with whipped cream and a cascade of fresh, colorful fruit! Australia and New Zealand 
            have always contended the origin of this recipe, but its name is actually dedicated to a famous 
            Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, whose tour of both countries in the 1920s was a resounding success.</P>
