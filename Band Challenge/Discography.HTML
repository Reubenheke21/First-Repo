    <p>Rwby Volume 3 comes out with a couple of old songs remodled or remade, they combine a couple of their
        old songs and put them in to one big instrumental called "R.W.B.Y vs F.N.K.I"
        however their most popular song on this album is "When it Falls" once again showcasing that rocky genre but also
        displaying new sounds that they are experimenting with, almost like they are trying to tell a story.
